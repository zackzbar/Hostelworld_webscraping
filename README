Greetings!

After traveling SE Asia for a year, I thought it would be fun to do some analysis on data from hostelworld.com, the go-to site for any long-term traveller.

Using Scrapy, I scraped data from Hostelworld on May 8, 2020.

Observations include every listed property from the top 5 destinations in each of the 11 SE Asian nations, and also Hong Kong. Fields include price, overall rating, component ratings, property description, and basic identifying info for each property.

Scrapy files can be found in the hostelworld folder.

This project was created during the NYC Data Science Academy Spring 2020 Data Science Bootcamp.

Thank you to everyone who helped along the way! And thanks to Hostelworld for the mems :D
