,Ubud,,Indonesia,"Ubud Ubud is a village in Gianyar regency 1 our away from Denpasar and really famous because of their art and culture, located amongst rice paddies and hills with the famous ayung ricer and wos river. Promoted as an arts and culture center, it has develop a large tourism industry. Tourism on the island develop after thearrival of Walter Spies and ethnic German born in Russia who taught painting and music and dabbled in dance. Ubud has a lot of tourism destination such as Puri Saren in Puri Ubud, Traditional art Market, Monkey Forest and Art Museum. The house compound: Traditionally, the Balinese compound appears to lack the adequate provision for sleeping, eating and bathing of the modern Western culture. All buildings within a Balinese compound lack wall; in the most basic house compound, the only pavilion building that is enclosed with walls is the pavilion where the head of the family sleeps. The rest of the family member sleep in an open pavilion. Pavilions are often wall-less, erected over a low plinth, and surmounted by a clay pantiles or thatched roof, which is supported by a timber or bamboo frame depending on wealth of the owner. The wall, if erected, only constitutes a screen to provide privacy and not a load-bearing structure. Each building in a house compound is identified with a certain cardinal direction, body organ, color and deity; depending on its placement. When a son of the family marries, his wife usually moves into his compound, so a compound is frequently a place for extended families, each with their own sleeping quarters, but otherwise sharing the facilities. Domestic activities take place outside or in the pavilion. Traditionally there is no bathing facility in a Balinese compound as people take their bath in public bathing pools. Central courtyard The central courtyard (natah), located in the center, is identified metaphorically with the navel. It is basically a packed earth central courtyard which is always kept free of vegetation except for a few ornamental flowers or decorative kamboja trees.[1] It is the symbolic center of the domestic microcosm. Family Shrine The family shrine is the most sacred area of the compound, located in the most auspicious northeast (kaja-kangin) corner of a Balinese house compound. It is identified metaphorically with the head.[1] The area of the family shrine is always enclosed within a sacred enclosure (pamerajan). Inside the family shrine area are shrines dedicated to various Hindu gods (e.g. Surya, Saraswati), nature spirits (Sridevi, Ibu Pertiwi), and family ancestors.[5] The most important shrines is the sanggah kemulan, a shrine containing three compartments dedicated to the Hindu trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The sanggah kemulan is a simple, house-like, wooden structure raised on pillars and standing on a column made of brick or sandstone. Sanggah kemulan is naturally located on the most sacred corner of the family shrine compound, the kaja-kangin corner. In Balinese Hindu religion, Brahma is also associated with male ancestors of the household, while Vishnu is with female ancestors. When a Balinese man marries, he should build one of these shrines.[5]} The family shrine area is not the only place for shrines. Other shrines, e.g. the sanggah pengijeng karang ('house-protecting shrine'), is traditionally positioned in the northwest (kaja-kauh) side of the house compound, to the west of the main pavilion. Pavilions Balinese pavilions (bale) can be identified with rooms in the western-style houses: each pavilion has its own different function. The Balinese people classified the pavilions according to the number of posts used in their construction. A four-posts pavilion is known as bale sakepat (Balinese 'four-post pavilion'), a six-posts is known as bale sakenam ('six-post pavilion'), and so on. The Balinese also classified the pavilion according to its position within the compound: a pavilion in the east (kangin) side of the compound is known as bale dangin ('east pavilion'), and so on. The most important pavilion in a Balinese house compound is the pavilion of the head of the household, known as bale daja ('north pavilion'), because it is located on the north (kaja) side of the house compound. It is also known as bale meten (Balinese 'sleeping pavilion'). The pavilion is the main sleeping room of the head of the household. It is often the only enclosed or walled pavilion within the house compound, and so it is also used to store family heirlooms. Bale daja is also the only pavilion with pointed roof, others being hip-roofed; a pointed roof is usually associated with sacred structure and is also used in the family shrines structure. Being the only place where privacy is available, the bale daja can be used for the newly weds; during the occasion, the head of the family will may move out temporarily. Other pavilions in a Balinese house compound are bale sakepat ('four post pavilion') or bale dangin ('east pavilion'), a pavilion with four posts and located in the east side of the house compound. Bale sakepat is traditionally reserved for the head of the other extended families living in the compound (usually brothers) or for holding important ceremonies (e.g. marriage or tooth-filing).[7] The pavilion for receiving guests, the bale tiang sanga ('nine post pavilion') or bale dauh ('west pavilion'), is situated in the west (kauh) side of the compound. The bale sakenam ('six post pavilion') or bale delod ('south pavilion') is located at the southern (kelod) end of the courtyard; a utilitarian pavilion which is traditionally used for women to do their weaving. Utilitarian structures The kitchen (paon), rice barn (lumbung) and sometimes a pigsty is identified with the legs and feet. The kitchen is typically situated in the southern end of the courtyard, the hearth is identified with sexual organs. The kitchen is usually the simplest structure in a Balinese compound. A kitchen usually employs a gable roof which is relatively easier than hip roof construction. The lumbung on the other hand is the most elaborate structure in a Balinese compound. Similar with other region in Indonesia, a lumbung is associated with goddess of rice Sridevi. A Balinese lumbung is basically a rice storage made of wooden deck raised high off the ground on posts that stand on foundation stones rather than a masonry plinth. Often a wooden platform is built below the rice storage, providing a shaded workplace by day and a sleeping deck at night. The design of the roof of a lumbung vary place to place; to the majority southern Balinese employs a hull-shaped thatched roof with horseshoe-shaped gable ends for their lumbung. This distinctive lumbung roof has been replicated for many bungalow resorts in Bali.[8] House gates The house gate (lawang) – the entrance to a compound – is ideally placed at the most inauspicious side of the compound, usually in the west wall towards the south end (kauh-kelod). It is identified with the anus. Sometimes this entrance is flanked with gate shrines (apit lawang). A small screen wall (aling-aling) is built directly behind the opening, screening off the interior and preventing evil spirits to enter the house compound. These house gates can be constructed with a simple alang-alang grass thatch or heavily ornate, the degree of elaboration reflects the economic status of the owner of the house. Hierarchy of a house compound Balinese Hinduism is strongly influenced by the caste system and ranks; this in turn affected the Balinese domestic architecture. There are four divisions in Balinese society: three noble caste (collectively named triwangsa) and the common man (shudra). The triwangsa is subdivided into royalty and warriors (satriya), priests (brahmana), and merchants (wesia).[9] The caste of the common man is entitled for the most basic type of a house compound: the pekarangan ('enclosure'). The pekarangan contains all the basic components: the sleeping pavilion (bale meten or daja), the other pavilions for mundane activities, a rice barn, and a kitchen; all are arranged around an open courtyard (natah). Family shrine is always positioned in the most auspicious corner at the north-east (kaja-kangin).[9] The residential compound of nobler triwangsa caste is built using the same principle as the common man's but with more complex proportion and decoration. The simplest type is the jero, which is very similar to the pekarangan with its single courtyard, although more elaborate. The main difference between the triwangsa caste with the common man is that the triwangsa is allowed to erect a bale gede ('grand pavilion'), a large pavilion supported by 12 posts and used for entertaining guests[1] or for important family rites of passage.[10] Another type of pavilion allowed for this caste is the bale dwaja ('standard/flag pavilion'), traditionally reserved for members of the satriya caste; and the bale lembu-gajah ('cow-elephant pavilion') traditionally reserved for Hindu or Buddhist priest. Other bale allowed for this caste is the bale bengong ('contemplating pavilion'), an pleasure pavilion used for resting or chatting. A Brahman who becomes a priest (pedanda) is entitled to a larger residence, called griya. Similarly, royal families are entitled a puri ('palace'). Both griya and puri consist of multiple courtyards instead of single courtyard. These multiple courtyards, similarly surrounded by pavilions, create its own subdivision within the extensive house compound. Each subdivision follows the same importance, and so the subdivision located in the kaja-kangin direction is always the most auspicious where the most important of the family shrines are usually located. In a royal palace, each courtyard compound corresponds to a specific use relating to royal duties. Despite the complexity of a griya or a puri, spatial orientation and hierarchical organization principle remains the same: the kaja-kangin is always the most auspicious corner. Principally, the consistent spatial orientation and hierarchy of Balinese traditional houses, whether it is the most lavish or the most humblest, are harmoniously linked with each other.[4] Nick’s Homestay Nick's Homestay is a peaceful oasis in the heart of busy Ubud, only 5 minutes walk from Monkey Forest and 15 minutes walk from Ubud Center or Ubud Traditional Market, restaurant and shopping center An ideally stay with a Balinese Family compound in the hearth of Ubud.
