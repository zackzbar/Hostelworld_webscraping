10.0,Sihanoukville,10.0,Cambodia,"One star accommodation with five star memories.  For the explorers, the adventurous and maybe those that just want to relax in a hammock at the edge of the world.  We strive to be kind to each other and to the environment so we use as little plastic and concrete as possible, instead you'll find locally sourced wood and grass as the construction material of choice. Our food follows the same rule, (mostly) local ingredients cooked from scratch by local staff for excellent results.  Within seconds of getting off the boat onto our beach you'll find yourself part of our family, this is somewhere you can really find seclusion and space to relax.  Koh Ta Kiev is the least populated of the 3 main Sihanoukville islands, perfect if you want to get away from it all. ***Property Policies & Conditions: 1. Cancellation policy: 1 day before arrival. 2. Check in from 12:30 to 23:00. 3. Check out before 9:30 noon. 4. Payment upon arrival by cash only. 5. Reception working hours 07:00-23:00. 6. No age restriction. 7. Taxes included. 8. Breakfast not included. 9. Smoking allowed. FAQ: Q. How do I get there? A. Our boat to the island departs from what used to be ""Banana beach bungalows"" location on Otres2 beach at 12:00 (10.561006, 103.557825). We also pick up from Shop 29 on Ream Beach at 12:30 (10.519063, 103.610997), this is sometimes more convenient if coming from Phnom Penh, Kampot or the Airport. You can put those coordinates into Google or Bing maps to find the exact locations. The boat cost 15$ per person for an open return ticket, and can be paid when you arrive at The Last Point. Q. How do I get from Koh Rong or Koh Rong Samloem to Koh Ta Kiev? A. Take the 9:30 boat to Serendipity beach, take a tuk tuk to Banana Beach Bungalows (Otres2), take our ferry at 12:00 to The Last Point ($15 per open return ticket) Q. Is there a direct ferry from Koh Rong or Koh Rong Samloem? A. No.  It takes the KR and KRS speedboats about 45 mins to do the 15km from those islands to Serendipty beach, it takes our longtail boat about 45 minutes to do the 5km journey from Otres2 (Banana Beach Bungalows) which is about a 25 minute tuk tuk (use Passapp to book for cheaper rides) ride away from Serendipity.  Unfortunately there is no direct ferry, KR and KRS are about 30-40km away from Koh Ta Kiev which would be an unsustainable 2 hour speedboat ride or an uncomfortable over ocean 4 hour longtail ride. Q. I'm arriving late in Sihanoukville, can I take a ferry to you later than 12:00? A. We only operate one ferry per day and can't guarantee any other services so if you are going to be too late you could either enjoy a night in Otres or try to find another ferry provider.  Banana Beach Bungalows (Otres 2) or Mangroves And More (in the village) are good places to try if you want to stay a night.  For later ferries, do ensure they go to the correct side of the island, many go to the north end which is a 40 minute trek through jungle to us.   Our neighbour ""Kactus"" often has a boat departing mid afternoon from Banana beach but we can't guarantee their service. Q. I'm too late to come today, can I come tomorrow? A. We understand, we're all travellers ourselves and know what it can be like.  We never charge for cancellations or modifications to bookings.  It would help us out if you could make the change on your online booking yourself though.  Most of the time it won't matter, we can just adjust your booking by a day and you can just join us a day later.  Relax, smile and we'll see you soon. Q. I'm arriving in Sihanoukville by bus from Phnom Pehn/Kampot/Kep, how do I get to Ream? A. If you will be on time for the 12:30 boat at Ream then get off the bus on the highway near Sihanoukville airport.  See the next question for the rest of the information. Q. I'm arriving in Sihanoukville airport, can I get a transfer? A. We don't offer a taxi service but our boat does pick up from the beach nearby the airport at 12:30 each day.  You could try the PassApp application before talking to the airport taxi drivers, it tends to be much cheaper, expect to pay around $4 - $8 for the 10 minute journey.  Your destination would be Shop29 on Ream Beach (https://goo.gl/maps/5EnVveNCHY2JY8cM8).  If you need a later pick up it is possible from Ream beach only but let us know in advance the date and time to make sure the boat is available and call 088 502 6930 when you set off in the taxi, we'll send the boat over to you and it's about a 15 minute boat journey, tickets costing $15 for an open return back to the mainland. Q. What time does the boat return to the mainland? A. The boat leaves the island at 09:30, can drop off at Ream beach at 09:50 by request and arrives at Banana Beach Bungalows on Otres 2 by 10:30 (or sooner if nobody needs to go to Ream) Q. What should I bring with me? A. We recommend: Swimming clothes, a rechargeable torch, coconut oil (prevents sand fly bites) and mosquito repellent (we have fewer mosquitos than the mainland but there's no harm in being careful).
