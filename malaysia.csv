Inside are lavish adornments : stained glass, crown moldings, gilded wood-carved doors, ceramic ornaments & seven staircases. *Sri Mariamman Temple : A typical South Indian temple with its elaborately sculptured & painted superstructure (called 'Gopura' in hindu) represents Mt Meru - the cosmic mountain that supports the heavens-that rises above its shrine.

Moreover, you can find a pool table, a ping pong table ( table tennis ), board games, mini games & darts at your arm’s reach.

The ice water is cooler than your ex-boy/girl friend's hearts, which is perfect for Malaysia’s tropical hot climate. Are you a coffee lover? Or you just simply can’t go through the day without caffeine in your veins? If your answer is YES for either, just stay here and you can enjoy our local coffee 24/7 for free! 4) 24 hours security & front desk assistance The building has a comprehensive 3-tier security surveillance system to ensure your safety at all times.
