Located in the heart of Koh Phangan perfectly between the famous Full Moon Party Beach of Haad Rin and the chilled out vibes of the West Coast, everything is easily reached from Phanganist Hostel and Headquarters. We have pushed the standard of dormitory to an all new high, offering guests clean quality AC rooms with bed separation, privacy curtain, light and power outlet and big lockers, so you can kick back and relax in the privacy of your own bunk. Guests also get 1 free drink at Drop In Bar Haad Rin every night that you would like to go to Haad Rin beach! We also have free BBQs every Full Moon; on the night before Full Moon Party and one on the day of Full Moon. We have a swimming pool complete with large sun deck and sun beds, a poolside bar, pool table and platform space for yoga, dance, fun and shenanigans. We have regular night-time events with the best DJs on Koh Phangan. Cool off with a swim and meet other guests and friendly staff whose mission is to make sure you have the best real Koh Phangan experience whatever desire or direction you want to take. We’re here to help! Drop In Bar was the first beach bar in Haad Rin and will celebrate its 28th anniversary next month, it’s been there since some of the very first years of the Full Moon party and has grown with it in many ways. Owner P Toh took over the family business in 1999 after he worked his way up from cleaning tables and gaining a fascination with music. Drop In Bar have some of the best knowledge of Koh Phangan’s most famous event which is the Full Moon Party, they know what you want to drink, what you want to dance to, how to give you the best fun and most importantly how to take care of you. Three years ago P Toh met Sharon the CEO and creator of Phanganist.com at the Full Moon Party! They formed a friendship and Pi Toh enlisted the services of the website Phanganist to help promote Drop In Bar and to take photos of their parties. From the start of the website in 2010 up to today Phanganist.com became well known for its photo coverage of the island’s famous party scene and there are now thousands of galleries with photos from most of the parties on the island. In 2013 it became important to cover all aspects of the island so Phanganist began writing daily articles and interviews with the island’s residents and visitors and on various subjects. Now Phanganist.com serves as the main online portal and magazine for the island with its ethos to show only positivity from Koh Phangan, who needs another negative media source? Not us! The great thing about this combination between Drop In Bar and Phanganist.com for the Phanganist Hostel is that you really do get the whole package! This is the creation of the local Thai people and Western Expats so that all aspects are carefully thought of with minds from both sides.

There a lots of shops, ATM's, banks, bars, hairdressers, tattooists, massages, restaurants and much more within no more than a 5 minute walk to anything in Haadrin, plus there is also a pier 30 seconds walk from th hostel which has 4 boats daily to Koh Samui daily.  Location is everything and Haadrin is really the only place to be at Full Moon. WHAT TO EXPECT: Fun, laughter, excitement and killer hangovers............ We are a Party Hostel and we actively encourage you to rock out, enjoy yourself, make friends and lay it all the line......... go hard or go home.  If you’re just looking for a place to crash and not socialise then we are probably not the place for you.  Although we have no reservations at all that some of our guests choose to stay in the hostel bar most if not all of the day drinking and getting properly on it during the day we actively encourage you to go out and explore this magical island, hangovers aren't the end of the world and just come and ask us some of the best ways to enjoy your time on Koh Phangan, we can arrange for a large scooter tour of some of the best spots on the island for those of you who check in early enough and want to explore a little bit before the real mayhem starts and we will even do it with you so you will get your own personal tour guide at no cost!!  And we all know we all like free stuff while travelling :) ACCOMODATION: We have a selection of different size dorms and private rooms available, from double and twin private rooms, 4, 10, 14 and 19 bed dorms.  All of our rooms and dorms are fully air conditioned with either en-suite or shared bathrooms with hot showers.  All rooms and dorms are cleaned twice daily however we would like you to let us know at any time if your room needs an extra clean/tidy or if there are any problems with your room so we can rectify it straight away for you.  You will be given fresh towels and blankets daily and should you need more or extra you just have to ask.  The blanket we give you is large and can easily fit over two people and is made from the towel material, they are all fresh, clean and soft for extra comfort THE BAR: This is where you will spend most of your time, our newly refurbished bar and restaurant is a great place to socialise.  It's huge and stacked out with comfy chairs and sofas so you can chill, relax, eat and drink with your new friends.  We constantly play killer drinking games but for those who just want to sit back and soak up the atmosphere while getting in the party mood there is more than enough room for everyone to feel at home.  However things tend to get out of hand pretty quickly so don't be surprised if you plan just to by yourself for a little while nursing last night’s hangover only to find you get dragged into a game of beer pong or ring of fire within a few seconds of sitting down.  We also have a free pool table and massive big screen TV with netflix and live sport and movies galore. The atmosphere tends to be pretty chill during the day but come night time we have a warm up party each night before each event over full moon so our bar trans-forms into a mini nightclub, cheap strong buckets plus a few vodka joss shots will get you in the mood along with an abundance of free uv body paint which will get you in the party spirit.  There will be great tunes blasting from the speakers and plenty of tables to dance on, we encourage you to do all of this!!! Like everywhere on Koh Phangan we have a minimum stay during full moon, however all other dates during the month including Half Moon you can now stay with us with no minimum stay required and our bar is great for pre-gaming before all the nightly parties such as HALF MOON, WATERFALL, EDEN, GUYS BAR, LOST PARADISE, LIGHTHOUSE AND LOI LAY. Most of you are coming to Koh Phangan to party and you won’t be disappointed, but should you wish to take a break from the many crazy party events then fear not as Koh Phangan is home to one of the world’s largest Yoga communities and away from the parties you will find some of Thailand's most stunning beaches, epic viewpoints, quirky night markets and some of the best tasting vegan food you are likely to find, so if you’re looking to chill then Haadrin is a great place to be when visiting the island when it’s not Full Moon as it super quiet and relaxed but you will still have the option to party should you feel in the spirit after a relaxing day at one of the many great areas the island has to offer and we at Jaya will happily give you a detailed run down of all the places you might want to hit up depending on what you’re looking for. FULL MOON Best day to arrive: We RECOMMEND that you arrive four nights before the Full Moon Party, as it’s a week-long festival rather than a single night of fun.

9.1,Koh Phangan,8.7,Thailand,"We are well known for being a party hostel, and yet the experience you will have is so much more enriched just during full-moon and Jungle experience and half-moon party. We are a mad house, but between those times don't expect anything too crazy, hostel is chill and provide family atmosphere, from the lifelong friendships you will make with travelers from all around the world. Originally, we had over 1000 reviews on Hostelworld. We have moved our hostel to a much better space in a beautiful location, and although we could not bring our reviews with us, we still embody the same energy that resonates with the nomadic spirit. The Nomad is a great environment for socializing! It is quickly becoming the lively backpacker community that it once was. Based out of Koh Phangan, it is conveniently located in one of the island's major party zones. At our house parties and kickbacks, whether it is a small crowd or a group of over a hundred people, there is always some sort of shenanigans to get into before the night leads into one of Koh Phangan's world-famous parties. The Nomad House is, however, a fairly large hostel and getting a decent night's sleep is easy. We get frequent regulars and many of our guests return, making the Nomad House just that: a home away from home. Come join the fun and make yourself at home! Our international, all-star staff members are always here for you to make your stay the best that it can be. Koh Phangan, while known for parties is a beautiful tropical island worth exploring. We encourage our guests to go to see the island and its natural beauty. 90% of the island is undeveloped, with untouched, pristine beaches and ancient jungles. We rent out scooters, and our awesome staff will organize group snorkeling and hikes to amazing viewpoints and beaches frequently. We sometimes even rent out a truck if there are enough people to pitch in for the cost and go exploring to some of Koh Phangan's most serene beaches. The Nomad House is located right next to the first western hospital and about 1 km away from the Thongsala pier (The main pier). So if you’re feeling lazy to walk to us, contact us, and we will pick you up. The Half Moon Festival, Black Moon Party, The Jungle Experience, and other major jungle parties are right in our neighborhood, with most located in the jungle behind the hostel. The world-famous Full Moon party is only a 15-minute ride away. For those looking to relax, our beach and our swimming pool are only 150 meters directly in front of the hostel. Around the hostel are also many activities such as many challenges Wipe-out, Slip and Fly, Flying Boat, Jungle trekking, temples, meditation retreats, yoga, kite surfing, Muay Tai boxing, fire shows, scuba diving/snorkeling, and a whole bunch more. Our dorm rooms are very comfortable and clean, with air conditioning, hot showers, free WiFi, lockers, and all beds come with blankets and towels. We also have a huge lobby with nice couches for those who want to just relax and perhaps nurse a nasty hangover. Although our rooms are nice, we do emphasize the fact that this is a social hostel. So if you want to just stay in your bed and not socialize, this might not be the best fit for you. Last but not least, we also have a restaurant on the property serving up western dishes, as well as Thai dishes using local ingredients and simple recipes. Great meals at very affordable prices and sometimes even free when the owner is cooking or when everyone contributes to family dinners! Come check us out! A few things to note: Please bear in mind that this is a very social and lively hostel. A sense of community is very strong at this hostel. We encourage group activities and parties and share experiences with other guests. This might not be the right place if you are looking for a relaxed and chill atmosphere or workplace. Cash payment for booking must be paid upon arrival. Check-in's before 11:00 AM must notify the Nomad House 24 hours in advance. Cancellation must notify the Nomad House at least 7 days in advance.
