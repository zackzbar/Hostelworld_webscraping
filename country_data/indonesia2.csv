You have found it.....and we are Bali's biggest hostel too!

All of our Dorms are 2, 3 & 4 bed dorms all with ensuite bathroom, aircon and comfy inner spring mattresses, in 2 story Balinese bungalows. *  4 Grades of rooms (Basic, Standard, Superior, Deluxe.....hence the variation in reviews). Deluxe rooms were fully refurbished 6 years ago and include WiFi repeater in the room, newer mattresses, duck down pillows, duvets, extra charging outlets, aircon with fan, bar fridge.  Our newly renovated Superior Dorms opened 06/19.  Our Basic private rooms are 40 years old, have not been renovated and are priced accordingly. *  Some hostels don't have a swimming pool....we have two, one with a swim up pool bar and a 22 jet Jacuzzi (no other hostel in Bali has that!!!).  Float in the pool on a beanbag with an ice cold Bintang in your hand, listening to your own music through our Spotify sound system. *  We arrange daily activities to help you meet other guests and can help you plan your stay in Bali.  Do you want to get out and about and see the real Bali or take a trip to Gili T???
