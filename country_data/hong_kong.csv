NOTICE: Our reception office is only on: Block A, 3rd floor of Chunking Mansions We don't have any office branch in other place! Our group name is only: HOSTELHK Group. Please beware of the FAKE. -------------------------------------------------------------------- What to see, where to eat and where to stay, Chungking Mansions could be listed under all of these categories. A Hong Kong landmark, made famous by Wong Kar Wai of Cannes fame, the mansions have become an attraction in their own right. Housed inside a maze like structure, Chungking used to be the first point of call for immigrants from every nation. Today it is still Hong Kong's centre of multiculturialism, famous in the city for its excellent Indian and Pakistani food, while its bargain basement guesthouses and hostels have been attracting backpackers for years. Chungking Mansions is a famous building in Hong Kong, China. It is located at 36-44 Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. The building is well-known as nearly the cheapest accommodation in Hong Kong with a single bed of US $8 one night. Though the building is supposedly residential, it is made up of many independent cheap hostels, shops, and other services. The strange atmosphere of this building is sometimes called by some 'the scent of Kowloon's Walled City'. Chungking Mansions features a labyrinth of guesthouses, curry restaurants, African bistros, clothing shops, sari stores, and foreign exchange offices. It often acts as a large gathering place for some of the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, particularly Indians, Middle Eastern people, Nepalese, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nigerians, Europeans, Americans, Pakistanis, Asians, and many other peoples of the world. The building was completed in 1961, at which time Chinese residents predominated. Now, after more than four decades of use, there are nearly 4,000 people living in the Mansions. With this lively mix of guest workers, mainlanders, local Chinese, tourists and backpackers, the Chungking neighbourhood is one of the most culturally diverse locations in Hong Kong. In a study by CUHK anthropologist Prof. Gordon Mathews, it is revealed that there are people from at least 120 different nationalities who have passed through Chungking Mansions in the past year. In the issue of 'TIME Magazine' on May 7, 2007, Chungking Mansions was elected as the Best Example of Globalization in Action in its annual feature The Best of Asia. -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Why choose us?

NOTICE: Our reception office is only on: Block A, 3rd floor of Chunking Mansions We don't have any office branch in other place! Our group name is only: HOSTELHK Group. Please beware of the FAKE. -------------------------------------------------------------------- What to see, where to eat and where to stay, Chungking Mansions could be listed under all of these categories. A Hong Kong landmark, made famous by Wong Kar Wai of Cannes fame, the mansions have become an attraction in their own right. Housed inside a maze like structure, Chungking used to be the first point of call for immigrants from every nation. Today it is still Hong Kong's centre of multiculturialism, famous in the city for its excellent Indian and Pakistani food, while its bargain basement guesthouses and hostels have been attracting backpackers for years. Chungking Mansions is a famous building in Hong Kong, China. It is located at 36-44 Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. The building is well-known as nearly the cheapest accommodation in Hong Kong with a single bed of US $8 one night. Though the building is supposedly residential, it is made up of many independent cheap hostels, shops, and other services. The strange atmosphere of this building is sometimes called by some 'the scent of Kowloon's Walled City'. Chungking Mansions features a labyrinth of guesthouses, curry restaurants, African bistros, clothing shops, sari stores, and foreign exchange offices. It often acts as a large gathering place for some of the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, particularly Indians, Middle Eastern people, Nepalese, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nigerians, Europeans, Americans, Pakistanis, Asians, and many other peoples of the world. The building was completed in 1961, at which time Chinese residents predominated. Now, after more than four decades of use, there are nearly 4,000 people living in the Mansions. With this lively mix of guest workers, mainlanders, local Chinese, tourists and backpackers, the Chungking neighbourhood is one of the most culturally diverse locations in Hong Kong. In a study by CUHK anthropologist Prof. Gordon Mathews, it is revealed that there are people from at least 120 different nationalities who have passed through Chungking Mansions in the past year. In the issue of 'TIME Magazine' on May 7, 2007, Chungking Mansions was elected as the Best Example of Globalization in Action in its annual feature The Best of Asia. -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Why choose us?
