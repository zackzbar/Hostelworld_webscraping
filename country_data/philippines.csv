We provide a peaceful, tropical environment Lounge in our breezy open space living area Take a nap in our garden patio Enjoy a cold drink in our alfresco seats For all to enjoy AYO Homtel | THE STORY … a little story from where and how AYO Homtel began. This Rustic Tropical Serene Home and Hostel was originally an 80’s house built by of a family who migrated to New Zealand in early 2000 just in time when a mother and her three children who also lived abroad looked for a house in Cebu to become their vacation home and establish their roots. With the help of a family friend, the late Architect Chris Abbu, the 80’s house was lovingly re-purposed but preserving the charm and vibe, adding more open spaces that set a seamless connection between the indoors and outdoors. The re-purposed house was then fondly called Kirana, “light of life” in Sanskrit which became their Christmas vacation home and repository of mementos gathered from different places, with each piece having its own story.  Main door wood carvings was from old Javanese home, stone art was bought from a street artist in Ubud Bali, bench built out of old rail tracks from Medellin, Cebu.  Indeed a fusion of pieces and stories from overseas and Cebu. As the three kids have grown, Kirana was less visited and the family, who are avid cultural and natural travelers themselves, decided to open it up as a second home to other travelers as well. AYO Homtel was then conceptualized, managed by the eldest son Gabriel. Rooms for family, group of friends or solo travelers were comfortably furnished, Wifi, parking, private and public comfort rooms, shower, lounging area and many more.  Further facelifts were done to make it into an even better place to stay in.  Breathtaking paintings were added such as the Big Hibiscus by Lyn Deutsch in the Living Area and flower paintings in the guest rooms by Nina (the owner’s niece) as well. To give a Cebuano flair to the place, the name AYO was picked as it captures the Asian hospitality to welcome guests knocking.  It also means “let’s go” in Indonesia where the three kids spent their growing up years.  Wikipedia says Ayo means Joy in Yoruba (African language). AYO Homtel is definitely a happy place to visit and experience.

Take some time to yourself and just be... Meet other travelers, eat locally grown fresh food, and enjoy the simplicity of life. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: We do NOT have any credit card facilities so please bring enough cash with you for food, drinks, tours and accommodation (if you haven’t already paid online). • ECO – ESCAPE: Solar Power, Composting Toilets, Outdoor Showers, Natural Ventilation, Life At Plumeria we are an off-the-grid eco escape, where we strive to live in harmony with the local environment. We have dry toilets (you’ll be taught how to use them) where the waste is composted and eventually will be converted into nutrient rich soil for the garden. Each room is designed to maximize airflow coming off the ocean, so we do not need fans or air-conditioning. The nights can be quite chilly, so we recommend bringing a light sweater or pants. We have solar power for DC lighting throughout Plumeria. We have a couple charging points, for your gadgets. Plumeria is designed to give you a comfortable stay fully immersed in nature… what that means is there will be bugs, chickens, maybe even the passing goat, pig, or cow. It’s not for everyone. But if your ready to get away, enjoy the simplicity, and reconnect with nature this may be the best place for you. • SIGNAL Plumeria is an escape which means you have the pleasure to escape from your social media and work emails as well. Put your cellphone away and enjoy the natural beauty. If you cannot break away from the rest of the world you can walk out during low tide to get signal just past our sea meadow about 100 meters into the ocean. Disconnect to connect! • BEACH Our beach is good for swimming during high tide, during low tide the tide goes out very far. There is some decent snorkeling in the deeper areas. We recommend bringing water shoes if you want to explore the future area as it can get quite rocky. • RESTAURANT All of our food is fresh and locally sourced as we strive to support local farmers and suppliers. We’re in the process of starting an organic farm/garden to supply majority of Plumeria’s food needs. Please let us know when you make your booking of any dietary requirements. • TOURS: Get completely away from the crowded El Nido Bacuit Bay and enjoy an ocean adventure to local islands, secluded beaches and caves, vibrant coral reefs, and learn to fish local style.

Imagine laying on one of the best beaches in the world and hearing the waves crash before you, all while sipping coconuts, drinking ice cold beers, and enjoying woodfire pizzas. At Mad Monkey Hostel Nacpan Beach, we’re right on the sand and we make the most of it with BBQs, volleyball, and paddleboarding. Sound like paradise? It gets even better when we throw in 30 minutes of free shots every evening in our bar, and then free shots every hour thereafter! Our resident DJ spins daily to keep the party going (as if you’ll need any more encouragement!). Grab a bite at our restaurant – just the spot if you’ve been craving woodfire pizzas. For solo travellers, our take on El Nido’s famous tours will get you in the mix with other visitors. Tour M is so famous, you have to sign up early. LOCATION, TOUR INFO, AND ACTIVITIES We are located 40 minutes north of El Nido Town, with a special Monkey tour taking off from Nacpan Beach itself. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, we run Tour M - our famous (so famous, you have to sign up early) combination tour inclusive of kayaking, snorkelling, and non-stop music. Tour M also features a 'boodle fight,' a military-style Filipino dining experience by the beach featuring fresh fish, chicken, pork, salads, rice, and fresh fruits. With the wide open beach just steps away, there’s plenty of space to get creative with sand sculptures before happy hour begins. From quiz nights to karaoke and beer pong sessions, our bar is the place to be once the sun sets – ask our staff about our nightly entertainment; there’s always something for everyone. ROOMS Our mixed dorms are fan rooms only and are fitted with bamboo beds with comfortable mattresses, free linen, and mosquito nets. The adventurous (and we mean the serious adventurous only - really basic) can stay in one of our basic tents, while those who prefer more space and privacy can stay in our glamping tents - a little glamorous with 2 king single mattresses and a fan, but still camping. Those who want even more privacy, our loft room with epic views (crave unlimited palm trees for Instagram?) is another option. All rooms are with shared bathrooms and come with towels and linen. IMPORTANT The most amazing, unspoilt places on earth aren’t always easy to get to. Mad Monkey Nacpan Beach is 16km from El Nido town, 12km from El Nido airport, and down a bumpy dirt road - so please be prepared for these before getting to paradise. Our rooms are clean and comfy, but simple and native. If you crave for air conditioning and 5-star fittings, it's best stay elsewhere. If you’re terrified of sand and the occasional creepy crawly, maybe just visit us for a day trip and have a Pacquiao Punch. If you’re adventurous and looking for a truly unique and unforgettable island experience on one of the most beautiful and unspoilt beaches in the world, we’ve got just what you’ve been looking for. Please be reminded that the nearest cash point (ATM) is 16 kilometres away in El Nido Town. We operate on purely cash basis, so please ensure you have enough cash to get you covered during your stay. Due to our isolated location, we have a very limited internet connection and this may only be used in emergencies. This means we have no Wi-Fi for you, which then means more time for you to socialise with real people. Lastly, all our rooms are fan-only and showers are cold (really refreshing though if you ask us). Glamping Tent Bookings --- please be aware that we have two types of glamping tents; standard and superior. They both have two king single mattresses, so it's perfect for both friends and couples. Fans are included in the tents; shared bathroom. Standard glamps are 3 x 3 metres, while superior glamps are 4 x 4 metres. While they are the same overall, superior glamping tents are bigger and have more space - it's always a great choice!
