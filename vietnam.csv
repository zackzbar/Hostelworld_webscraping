Rating & Awards: The Orchid Hotel have been well quoted in the new / updated published guide book LONELY PLANET - 10th Edition / July 2009. ( Page CENTRAL VIETNAM ..Hue 225) ' This sparkling new hotel has been receiving rave reviews for impeccable service and sterling accommodation that outstrips its three-star competitors.

(Source : Tripadvisor.com) What did customers like about Orchid Hotel? 'A Most Amazing Place, and The Most Wonderful Staff Ever' Jul 26, 2010 | Trip type: Business My son and I traveled to Hue for both business and pleasure. We found this hotel on tripadvisor.com, and this is the best place we stayed on our trip through four cities in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Vung Tau, Hue, and Hanoi). Not only that, it has the nicest and most competent and caring staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world. What a place! This hotel is beautiful, with curb appeal from the outside, and it is just as attractive inside. Its lobby is intimate and lovely, the dining room has a beautiful decor with a fountain on one wall. The room we were in is elegant, with a wood appointed decor and great beds, with free internet access constantly available on the provided in room computer. The most marvelous thing at the Orchid Hotel is something money cannot buy, a staff that truly is caring and genuinely passionate about providing the best quality service anyone can imagine. From housekeeping to the manager, they were superior. The bellmen where always there to help and to arrange services and trips needed, the receptionists at the front desk were like best friends, making you feel so welcome 100% of the time regardless of which one was on duty (thank you all so very much), the cooks and waitresses in the restaurant always had a great breakfast tailored to individual needs, the driver in the hotel car provided for an out of town business trip to Da Nang and found a conference when I had no real address for it...he was amazing. These wonderful people all make you feel not only welcome, but as part of their family while there. There is a gentleness, and genuiness about this staff that starts at the top, from the manager, Mr Dung,who so obviously cares about his staff and it resonates through the entire hotel. They greet you when you come down by name and worry about you when you do not. They truly care about their guests as if they have welcomed you into their personal homes and show you the best care that I have ever had in a hotel anywhere. This is a world class staff, whose style should be envied by any hotel regardless of how many stars it has acquired. For service alone, on a five star hotel rating scale, this staff gets a rating of ten stars from me. They are over the top, way over the top! If I could make a suggestion, it would be that other hotels world wide should send staff to the Orchid Hotel to see how a hotel should treat guests. It would improve hotel service for any who copied their style and sophistication. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, from travelers such as my son and I, to kings and political leaders. They made us feel like royalty and we are just a teacher and a college professor. We felt as if they scattered flower petals in our paths where ever we went, and somehow, I think they really did. Only they and we know how much that is really true! To the staff of the Orchid Hotel, all of you, I thank you for making our stay memorable beyond belief. You are the best ever. I only wish I could stay with you where ever I go. Somehow that is just not possible, So I must return to Hue to your hotel. Count on it!

7.0,Hoi An,8.0,Vietnam,"Loc Phat Hoi An - Villa is run by Mrs. Linh, whose family has lived on the same property for 4 generations. It’s named after my sons, Phat (which means development) and Loc (Luck). My roots stretch back to a small fishing village near Hoi An beach, while my husband’s family has lived on the property I now operates from for over a century. Linh claims to have established the first professional homestay in Hoi An and everything I has learned during my time working in hospitality is visible in the day to day going-ons of the Villa. Stay for a night and you will notice the family’s impact on every aspect of life in Loc Phat. Linh’s children, nieces, and nephews run around and play with their toys, my father-in-law stands aged and smiling as security, my sister greets you from behind the reception desk, my sister/brother-in-law serve you a complimentary breakfast, and my aunt will clean your room. In fact every employee of the homestay is a member of the extended family. ”We respect everything we have, because we are very lucky to have it” The homestay is more than just a business for us, it’s a way of life. The Homestay Villa has recently added brand new buildings to its complex, so visitors no longer live within Linh’s home, we have our own beautiful modern private rooms to retire to, all built around the tranquil garden. However interaction with the family is still a large part of the experience, and any guest who wishes to sit down for a chat or simply observe is greeted with open arms and a smile. Linh is an intrepid and well versed cook, and I exhibit my skills for the dinners I enjoys cooking for my guests for someone stay in the Villa are looking forward to have cooking class you will be composed of Cao Lau noodles (made from a secret recipe that is known to only one family in Hoi An), green mango salad, fresh spring rolls, and the famous Hoi An pancakes……….. with Linh for a home cooking class. Linh also takes great pleasure in talking with my guests and spends hours of my day interacting with anyone who has a question or is curious about the Hoi An way of life. I will organize any manner of trip for her visitors, from a excursion to a lantern making shop, a trip to a local market for ingredients used in the cooking class, or mundane things like arranging taxi service to the airport…………etc. The Homestay likes to give back to the community and every year Linh and my husband sponsor the education of two children, one from Linh’s fishing village and one from Hoi An. Since there is no such thing as free public school in Vietnam many children, especially the third or fourth born in any family, are in danger of missing out on a formal education. Linh was one of only five children to go to school in her village, so she has a deep empathy for the plight of uneducated children in the region. In addition the homestay also gives away a bicycle to one lucky child at the end of every year. If you haven’t already gathered we were charmed by Hoi An, Loc Phat Hoi An Homestay Villa, and the family living there and operating it. If you want to experience an authentic slice of Vietnamese life within Hoi An City, book a stay at the Homestay Villa. You will be welcomed to the family with big smiles and open arms. We thank you again for choosing Loc Phat for your stay in Hoi An. Linh Family and staffs. Loc Phat Charity Fund. As we are part of the Hoi An community we believe it is our role to give back to our community. We do this by helping children from poor families who show high academic skills, with the costs of their education. The Loc Phat Charity Fund was established in 2011 and since that time we have been able to grant scholarships to 6 students who have shown academic excellence and meet the criteria.
